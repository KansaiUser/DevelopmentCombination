# DevelopmentCombination
This repo is a very simple example in order to apply the concepts written in https://levelup.gitconnected.com/how-to-combine-c-cmake-googletest-circleci-docker-and-why-e02d76c060a3

In order to make it work, I wrote very simple code, and corrected some errors in the article. 

Status: Right now, I have performed the procedure until gtests. Although in order to do all this I have developed a docker container based on the one in the article.
